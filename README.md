# Why is it not in the Chrome web store?
I don't have a developer account, and can't be bothered to pay the fee to publish it.

If you have a developer account for the chrome web store, you can publish it as long as you give proper attribution to me and link this repo.


# Its broken! Plz help!!1!
Either Octopart changed something to how the query's are build into the URL. Or chrome has changed something that prevents the extension to work. You can try and fix it by looking into the *background.js* and changing how the query URL is built.

Note: I will not upgrade this into using the Octopart API since that needs a license.


Enjoy!
